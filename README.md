# PERSONAL-PORTFOLIO-WEBSITE


This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional profile as a web developer. Built entirely using HTML and CSS, this portfolio serves as a digital resume and a visual representation of my growth and capabilities in web development.

The development environment for this project was Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which offered an efficient and feature-rich workspace. With VS Code’s powerful extension support, integrated terminal, and real-time preview features, I was able to streamline my workflow and maintain a consistent coding environment throughout the project.

The website is structured using HTML5, which provided a semantic and well-organized layout. Each section of the site, such as Home, About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact, is clearly defined using appropriate HTML tags. The use of semantic HTML ensures accessibility, SEO-friendliness, and maintainability of the codebase.

For the visual design and styling of the website, I used CSS3. I implemented modern design principles including responsive layouts, hover effects, custom fonts, and smooth transitions to enhance user engagement and provide an aesthetically pleasing experience. CSS Flexbox and Grid were utilized to manage the layout and alignment of elements across different screen sizes. The goal was to create a clean, professional look that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The color palette, typography, and spacing were all carefully selected to reflect a modern and personal brand identity. I also added interactive elements such as navigation hover states, animated buttons, and a responsive navigation bar that adapts to smaller screens. These small yet meaningful enhancements make the user experience more dynamic and enjoyable.

Each section of the website serves a distinct purpose:

The Home section introduces the viewer to who I am, setting the tone for the rest of the site.

The About section gives a brief background about my journey and interests in web development.

The Projects section showcases key projects I’ve worked on, providing a glimpse into my practical skills.

The Skills section highlights the technologies and tools I’m familiar with, giving potential clients or employers a quick overview of my technical stack.

The Contact section includes links to my email and social profiles, making it easy for people to reach out or connect.

All files and folders are neatly organized for easy navigation and future updates. I’ve followed a modular CSS structure and written clean, readable code with proper indentation and comments where necessary. This ensures that any future enhancements, whether it's adding new sections or integrating JavaScript for interactivity, can be done efficiently.

I used Git for version control throughout the development process. This allowed me to track changes, manage backups, and maintain a clean development history. The commits are well-documented and reflect the various stages of development, from layout structuring to styling and responsive testing.

Creating this portfolio from scratch using only HTML and CSS helped reinforce my understanding of fundamental web development principles. It also challenged me to be creative with design and thoughtful with layout, without relying on JavaScript or frameworks.

In conclusion, this portfolio website not only demonstrates my technical skills but also reflects my dedication to building beautiful and functional websites using core web technologies. I will continue to update this site as I grow and complete more projects, and I look forward to using it as a platform to share my journey with the world.
